					<p>HAPPY VALENTINES DAY!!</p>
					<br>
					<p>I don't really celebrate Valentine's Day (for many reasons, mainly my aromanticism), so I don't really have anything Valentine-specific to post about. Instead, I thought I'd update y'ou'all on what's been happening these past two weeks since my last post.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Firstly.. my Late Corner CD arrived! Included in the package was a bonus CD: the TAOMOS Sampler CD!!! That CD hadn't been posted online ever, and this the ONLY copy in existance. It is officially the rarest thing in my collection.</p>
					<img src="/alloftheabove/images/vaccds.jpg" width="200px" hight="200px">
					<p>Secondly.. my Russian Spy Camera CD arrived!!! RSC is a band I've been researching for a few months now, there's not a lot about them online, but one of the things thst seems to be in "abundance" are these CDs. There's a few on Amazon, one on a record store website, and a couple on Discogs. From what I can gather, this seems to be the only CD they ever released, despite there being three studio albums from this band. There were plans for a CD release of their second album (which i very much prefer to this one), but that didn't happen for very odd reasons. Anywho, I'm glad to have this obscure piece of the 2000s Athens scene in my collection.</p>
					<img src="/alloftheabove/images/IGOTIT.jpg" width="200px" hight="200px">
					<p>And finally.. my Cojum Dip stickers arrived!! So, back on like the fifth I think?? Bora made a Shopify store for Cojum Dip (<a href="https://cojumdip.myshopify.com/">shop.cojumdip.com</a>) where he's selling the Sonic Lunch merchendise. I managed to snag me some stickers from it!! I am very very pleased to own some of the very few Cojum Dip merch in existance (of course i know quite a few people have the sonic lunch merch, but like, theres the sonic lunch merch and the 2005 shirts and thats basically it lmao).</p>
					<img src="/alloftheabove/images/cojumstickers.jpg" width="200px" hight="200px">
					<p>Alright, so about FAWM.. I kinda haven't done it much. I have two actual songs in the works, a joke song, an ultrabox song, and an instrumental. That's it. Hopefully by the end of the month I'll at least have a few more songs to start a project off of.</p>

					<p>FAWM FAWM FAWM IS HERE!!!!!!!!</p>
					<br>
					<p>It's that time of year, folks. The time where we try (and probably fail) to write an albums worth of songs in 28 days. If you haven't ever heard of FAWM, please check it out at <a href="https://fawm.org/">fawm.org</a>, it'll tell you everything you need to know. But, if you're stubborn and refuse to visit sites you don't know, I'll give you the rundown:</p>
					<br>
					<p>FAWM (short for "February Album Writing Month") is a songwriting challenge where you try to write 14 songs in 28 days. They don't have to be fully finished, produced, mixed, etc., they just need to exist. You could continue working on your FAWM songs for as long as you like! And you don't even need to do the full 14 songs, you can do as many as you like.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Doesn't that sound interesting? It sure does to me, which is why I will be participating this year! If all goes to plan, <em>hopefully</em> I'll have enough songs to start an album with. I'll update this blog with my progress.</p>
					<br>
					<p>In other news, my <a href="https://latecornermusic.bandcamp.com/album/the-latest-corner">Late Corner</a> CD say it'll be arriving TOMORROW. I doubt it. The roads still have snow on them (though i can see lots of pavement!). My Russian Spy Camera CD says it'll be here by friday, which I find much more believable.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Basically, to summarize this entry, hoogabooga FAWM + CDs shipped.</p>

					<p>Some things happened..</p>
					<br>
					<p>OKOK FIRST THING.... Vacaroni CDs are real!!! More specifically, Late Corner CDs. You know Late Corner, Vac's "joke" band? Well, they just put out a live album AND a new studio EP , and released limited edition CD-Rs of the live album! I already purchased a copy because it's funny, you can buy them <a href="https://latecornermusic.bandcamp.com/album/the-latest-corner">here</a>.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Second thing.. I put put a new album! ..kinda. It's under my joke band Sapphire Spirit. It's a joke album and not meant to be taken seriously. ..but it still happened! You can download that <a href="https://sapphirespirit.bandcamp.com/album/the-moment-i-shot-my-eyes-out-with-a-bb-gun-and-saw-god">here</a>.</p>
					<br>
					<p>I also made myself a patreon!! You can follow that <a href="https://www.patreon.com/cw/Spottz">here</a>. There's no paid tier as I have no way of recieving the money, so if you want to give me money, you're out of luck kiddo.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Also, snow update. The schools are closed for a few more days, and apparently it's supposed to snow EVEN MORE on friday (i think, could've been sataurday). HOPEFULLY we can get a delivery order in on thursday so we can replenish our food supplies, might not happen though. Stay safe out there in the snow, I'd hate for you to lose your soul!</p>

					<p>IT SNOWED!!!!!!</p>
          <br>
          <p>Yes, that's right, here in Arkansas it snowed. We got 5 inches!!! And we'll be getting some more over the evening and into the night. I haven't been out there to check it out quite yet (I woke up in a bit of a funk), but I'm going to try to get out there this afternoon after my mom wakes up from her nap.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Also, I made this page today. Actually, I started testing it last night immediately after posting the update on the homepage. Oops! That's ok though, it just means I wont have so much work to do later.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Hmm, what else is there to talk about? There's things happening with my friends today, I'm not sure if they'd like me to talk about that publicly though. One of them I'll probably post about later.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Anywho, that's my first blog post! Exciting, ain't it? I'll try to use this more often than I've used blogs in the past.</p>
